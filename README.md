## Usage

* **Spot ID:** This will assign your HEX value to the SpotLight. ***(Make sure no duplicate SpotIDs are inside your Scene!)***

* **Temperature:** Add warmth to your light with this value. The higher your temperature the more orange it gets.
* **Cast Shadow:** Set to "1" if you want your light to produce shadows. Set to "0" to disable.
* **Bounce Lights:** Set to "1" if you want light to bounce off objects (similar to ray tracing). Set to "0" to disable.
* **Enabled:** Set to "1" to enable your light. Set to "0" to disable (the light will no longer appear in-game).
* **Power:** Set the strength of your light.
* **UmbraAngle:** Determines the overall angle of the spotlight cone.
* **penUmbraAngle:** Specifies the angle at which the light intensity starts to decrease (penUmbra) and becomes fully attenuated (Umbra).
